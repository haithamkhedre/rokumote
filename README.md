## Getting started

You can get the latest [release by clicking this link](https://github.com/nod/rokumote/releases/tag/v0.3).   Just download it and put it in your Applications folder.  Double click then roku all the things.

## But why?

Because my kids sometimes lose the remote and I wanted something slightly
prettier than the python cli I whipped up.

## Who do you blame for this?

- @jcarbaugh made a great
  [python-roku](http://github.com/jcarbaugh/python-roku) library that inspired
  me
- @jarrodb dared me to do it
- my kids because they keep losing the remote
- I wanted to learn a little bit of swift

## How do I build this?

**note** You'll need xcode 6.3+ and cocoapods installed.

Clone this repo (or fork it and then clone it)

```
git clone https://github.com/nod/rokumote.git
```

Then install the dependencies

```pod install```

Then build it in xcode (if you don't know this step... Do you even github?)
